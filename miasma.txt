A legend was born on one night dark as coal,
when heroes fought with honor to lighten their soul,
with mead and ale as their prime arm of choice,
they sought to bring down the sorrow long gone.

The battle was fierce like in the days of old,
There was chanting and shouting and tankards were cold,
Or so do you think for what you can recall,
Everythingâ€™s hazy, did your skull fight a wall?

After the twilight of night's final chord,
A warrior has to meet with the deeds of their sword,
What you loan for sure you'll need to pay,
Even if your last wish was a cozy home stay.

The bitter truth to swallow if one just can,
Is that stream of tomorrow won't wait a mortal man,
So accept your fate and respond to your hail,
As your peers are waiting, ready to sail.
